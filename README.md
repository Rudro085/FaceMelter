# FaceMelter

**FaceMelter** is a JUCE-based guitar distortion pedal plugin, designed to deliver an aggressive, high-gain sound that melts faces!

## Features

- **High-Gain Distortion**: Dial up the heat with intense, saturated distortion.
- **Unique Tone Shaping**: Inspired by a blend of iconic guitar pedals, but with its own unique tonal footprint.
